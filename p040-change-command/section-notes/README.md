### Inconsistent behavior of change compound command:


Change-to-end-of-word, `ce`, will remove the character under the cursor:

![change-to-end](./assets/change-to-end-of-word.png)

Note that in the above, the character under cursor `d` was removed.



Change-to-beginning-of-word, `cb`, will not remove the character under the cursor:

![change-to-back](./assets/change-to-beginning-of-word.png)

Note that in the above, the character under cursor `d` was NOT removed.
